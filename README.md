# singly-linked-list
Given	a	singly-linked	list,	devise	a	time- and	space- efficient	algorithm	to	find	the	mthto-last	element	of	the	list.		Implement	your	algorithm,	taking	care	to	handle	relevant	
error	conditions.		Define	mth	to	last	such	that	when	m=0,	the	last	element	of	the	list	is	
returned.
